# *************************** USER-DEFINED FUNTION **************

# for creating a funtion we are  use DEF keyword

# user defined funtion :-
# we giving our own name to the funtion
# And ask it to perform certain task --> user defined funtion

#syntax:- 

# def funtion_name(parameters):
    # body

# calling the Funtion
 
# funtion_name(arguments):


def apple(a,b):
    print(a+b)

apple(4,2)

def sub(a,b):
    print(a-b)

sub(23,33)

def yash(a,b):
    print("mul is:-",a*b)
    print("div is:-",a/b)
yash(23,3)


#task:
# create a user defined funtion to add n number off intergers.
# like:- add(1,3,5,2)
